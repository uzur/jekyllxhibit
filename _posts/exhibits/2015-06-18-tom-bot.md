_Using Twitter as a platform for a performance_

Somewhat continuing from my _Share + Share Alike_ project, I wrote a bot that utilises Twitter's developer API and OAuth token to tweet _I am still alive_ at random time intervals forever.

This project was inspired by a similar work of an On Kawara bot, which tweets this same message at random times every day.

<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs");</script>
