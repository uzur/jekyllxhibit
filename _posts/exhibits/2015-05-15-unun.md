_DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN
<br>
WE DECIDED WE'D BE FRIENDS AGAIN
<br>
OUR WORLD BEGAN TO BEND 
<br>
TOWARDS A RADIANT END
<br><br>
WHEN SPRING FLOWERS
<br>
TURNED TO WINTER SHOWERS
<br>
THE LATE ENDING NIGHTS
<br>
AND HOTBLOODED FIGHTS
<br><br>
WE CHASED OUR GHOSTS AWAY
<br>
BENEATH A CANVAS GREY
<br>
WITHOUT FEAR FOR MY SINS
<br>
WHAT AM I TO DO THEN?_
