The [IOWA Collective][iowa] have their first show at Studio One Toi Tu. I have been involved with this show which involves performances every week around Auckland City, and documentation of these performances are displayed at the Studio One Gallery.

Simultaneously, I have been working on my third project for this year. The project is centered around photography, specifically security cameras as an artistic tool. Images of the work and documentation will be uploaded in the next few days on a project site similar to [p2][p2]

Sincerely,
Tom Hackshaw
