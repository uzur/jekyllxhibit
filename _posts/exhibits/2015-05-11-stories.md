  _"This site acts as a digital archive for true/untrue stories, copypastas and spam (which have a narrative quality to them) written by people. It is part of an ongoing art project by Tom Hackshaw which explores the nature and idea of telling someone something._ 
<br><br>
_To submit stories (true or untrue), contact the author hi@tomhackshaw.com and specify:_
<br><br>
_* the story itself_
<br>
_* if you would like credit for your story (otherwise "anonymous")_
<br>
_* the title_
<br>
_* any supporting images/documentation_

<br>
_There is no length limit, so go crazy!_
