## It's Okay We're Artists

_"The I.O.W.A Collective are a group of interdisciplinary artists from the Elam School of Fine Arts.
<br>
We focus our practice on site-specific art, demonstrated through various mediums and disciplines.
<br>
In our work as a collective, site-specific means dismantling hierarchies, boundaries between past and present, artist and audience."_
