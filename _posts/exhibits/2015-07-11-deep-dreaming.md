Utilising [Google's Neural Network algorithm][source], which was recently open sourced to allow researchers and artists alike to study, I used photographs that I had previously taken and put it through this algorithm. (More information regarding [Artificial Neural Networks][ann].

From the original source by Alexander Mordvintsev, Christopher Olah and Mike Tyka:

_"One of the challenges of neural networks is understanding what exactly goes on at each layer. We know that after training, each layer progressively extracts higher and higher-level features of the image, until the final layer essentially makes a decision on what the image shows. For example, the first layer maybe looks for edges or corners. Intermediate layers interpret the basic features Alexander Mordvintsev, Software Engineer, Christopher Olah, Software Engineering Intern and Mike Tyka, Software Engineerto look for overall shapes or components, like a door or a leaf. The final few layers assemble those into complete interpretationsâ€”these neurons activate in response to very complex things such as entire buildings or trees."_ 

In an nutshell, it attempts to reinterpret the image and read what is happening through Google's image recognition algorithm. That result is then outputted to create these dream-like images.

Examples of other deep dream images created using this technique can be found [here][here], and on Twitter under [#deepdream][dd].
