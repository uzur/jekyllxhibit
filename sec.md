For email, please send anything to my Inventati account (**tomhackshaw** at **inventati** dot **org**), which has servers in Norway, Netherland and Iceland (all with relatively strong privacy laws). If you are going to email this account please always use PGP otherwise I ***will not*** respond. Please keep in mind that metadata in the email (the subject line as well as the email headers) are **not** encrypted, although I strip all of my IP logs in all of my emails from this account.
