_Using Twitter as a platform for a performance_

Somewhat continuing from my _Share + Share Alike_ project, I wrote a bot that utilises Twitter's developer API and OAuth token to tweet _I am still alive_ at random time intervals forever.

This project was inspired by a similar work of an On Kawara bot, which tweets this same message at random times every day.
