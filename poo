## An exploration into painting

Painting module done over the course of four weeks.
<br>
<br>
<br>
_"This project will introduce you to painting as a material, surface, and process based practice."_
<br>
<br>
_"This project is in two parts. For the first part you will produce a body of work in response to Richard Serra's Verb List (1967-68) by creating your own list, acting out each activity with paint or materials of your choice, with tools and implements of your choice."_
<br>
<br>
_"In the second part of the project you will be using the processes and methodologies from your experiments with the verb list and developing them into resolved painting outcomes."_
