From the project website:


_" 'Unreal City Estate' is a project where people get together and create 'an imaginary city' that could exist alongside the real city we live in today. Vacant space around the neighborhoods are divided into small sections. Each section will be put out on lease for people who are contributing to help create the ‘unreal city’. Our ‘imagination’ is the ‘money’ in the ‘unreal city’- people are required to pay with their unique vision to transform the sections that they are going to use,which become the most important part of they project. There will be a lot of exchange of conversation between the ‘real’ and the ‘imaginary’. “Unreal City Estate” requires terms and conditions that functions the same way as the real estate-promoting properties. Through the process of negotiation and signing a contract with the residents we finally establish ‘unreal city’- a ‘model city’- on the section we decide on. The creation of the ‘unreal city’ within the real city makes us realize the possible situations and events that could already have existed in our everyday lives,but never thought of doing or make it happen. The purpose of “Unreal City Estate” is not just to build a ‘city’. The process of ‘editing’ our realities with our ‘imagination’ plays the most significant part of this project."_
